##            Quick Primer on addnode vs connect            ##
##  Let's say for instance you use addnode=4.2.2.4          ##
##  addnode will connect you to and tell you about the      ##
##    nodes connected to 4.2.2.4.  In addition it will tell ##
##    the other nodes connected to it that you exist so     ##
##    they can connect to you.                              ##
##  connect will not do the above when you 'connect' to it. ##
##    It will *only* connect you to 4.2.2.4 and no one else.##
##                                                          ##
##  So if you're behind a firewall, or have other problems  ##
##  finding nodes, add some using 'addnode'.                ##
##                                                          ##
##  If you want to stay private, use 'connect' to only      ##
##  connect to "trusted" nodes.                             ##
##                                                          ##
##  If you run multiple nodes on a LAN, there's no need for ##
##  all of them to open lots of connections.  Instead       ##
##  'connect' them all to one node that is port forwarded   ##
##  and has lots of connections.                            ##
##       Thanks goes to [Noodle] on Freenode.               ##

# By default, only RPC connections from localhost are allowed.
# Specify as many rpcallowip= settings as you like to allow connections from other hosts,
# either as a single IPv4/IPv6 or with a subnet specification.

# NOTE: opening up the RPC port to hosts outside your local trusted network is NOT RECOMMENDED,
# because the rpcpassword is transmitted over the network unencrypted and also because anyone

# You can use Bitcoin Private or btcpd to send commands to btcpd

# Transaction Fee

# Send transactions as zero-fee transactions if possible (default: 0)
#sendfreetransactions=0

# Create transactions that have enough fees (or priority) so they are likely to # begin confirmation within n blocks (default: 1).
# This setting is overridden by the -paytxfee option.

# Miscellaneous options

# Enable attempt to mine Bitcoin Private.
#gen=0

# Set the number of threads to be used for mining Bitcoin Private (-1 = all cores).
#genproclimit=1

# Specify a different Equihash solver (e.g. "tromp") to try to mine Bitcoin Private
# faster when gen=1.
#equihashsolver=default

# Pre-generate this many public/private key pairs, so wallet backups will be valid for
# both prior transactions and several dozen future transactions.
#keypool=100

# Pay an optional transaction fee every time you send Bitcoin Private.  Transactions with fees
# are more likely than free transactions to be included in generated blocks, so may
# be validated sooner. This setting does not affect private transactions created with
# 'z_sendmany'.
#paytxfee=0.00
